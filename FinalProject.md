# Introduction 

This dataset includes 23486 rows and 10 feature variables. Each row corresponds to a customer review, and includes the variables:

Clothing ID: Integer Categorical variable that refers to the specific piece being reviewed.
Age: Positive Integer variable of the reviewers age.
Title: String variable for the title of the review.
Review Text: String variable for the review body.
Rating: Positive Ordinal Integer variable for the product score granted by the customer from 1 Worst, to 5 Best.
Recommended IND: Binary variable stating where the customer recommends the product where 1 is recommended, 0 is not recommended.
Positive Feedback Count: Positive Integer documenting the number of other customers who found this review positive.
Division Name: Categorical name of the product high level division.
Department Name: Categorical name of the product department name.
Class Name: Categorical name of the product class name.

In our data set we will try to explore trends in the customer reviews from an anonymized women clothing E-commerce platform.

# 1 - Looking into data set


First step is to clean our data set and look if there are any empty cells.

  </tr>

</table>

There are 4697 empty cells. In these step we get rid of them.
After first cleaning in our dataset we have 19662 observations and 11 variables 


# 2 - Distributon of individual variables 


```r
list = c("Clothing.ID","Age" , "Rating" , "Recommended.IND" ,"Positive.Feedback.Count")
summary(data.full[list])
```

```
##   Clothing.ID          Age            Rating      Recommended.IND 
##  Min.   :   1.0   Min.   :18.00   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.0000  
##  1st Qu.: 861.0   1st Qu.:34.00   1st Qu.:4.000   1st Qu.:1.0000  
##  Median : 936.0   Median :41.00   Median :5.000   Median :1.0000  
##  Mean   : 921.3   Mean   :43.26   Mean   :4.183   Mean   :0.8182  
##  3rd Qu.:1078.0   3rd Qu.:52.00   3rd Qu.:5.000   3rd Qu.:1.0000  
##  Max.   :1205.0   Max.   :99.00   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :1.0000  
##  Positive.Feedback.Count
##  Min.   :  0.000        
##  1st Qu.:  0.000        
##  Median :  1.000        
##  Mean   :  2.652        
##  3rd Qu.:  3.000        
##  Max.   :122.000
```


Looking threw our summary we can see that the biggest median is in the variables age and Clothing ID. This result is resonable becouse those 2 variables have big numbers in their column. Clothing ID numbers can have values even to a number over a thousand and Age value can also have a big values. Both of those columns represent continous variables.

In this part the focus will be on the values that are represented by numbers.

We look deeper into data to look see what is going inside. 

#Densities

We looked into densities of two values that made sense the most to look into. 
First one was Age , we wanted to see how the density of age of our customers look like. 
From the graph we can see that the biggest value is near the age of 35.
This means customers in that age are our biggest target. 


![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Second density to look closer to was Positive Feedback Count. We wanted to see how the denisty of positive feedbacks looked like. 
As we can see the biggest number on a density plot is near zero. 
Which means that not that many people might have left a positive feedback.


![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

To look into other numberic variables we used bar graphs to see how the data looks like. 

##Recomendation of a product 

In the graph below we can see that most of the customers 81% recomended the product and 18% didn't.


![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

Next variable we looked more closely to is Rating. This is a categorical variable which can be scored from values 1 to 5. 
On the graph we can see that the biggest bar is on the number 5, so 55% of people which left the rating rated the prodcut with the highest possible values.


![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->


#Divison Name 

Next variable shows that the biggest number of items is in the section General.

![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->


#Departament Name 

To look closer into the products , we counted which of the product has the most occurances in our database. 
The most visible product was Tops with 8715 occurances.

![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

#Class Name 

We also wanted to know the count of each of the products. 
The biggest one was Dresses. 

![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->



#Product popularity

It was also important to see which of the products had the biggest popularity.
Products with id 1087 , 862 and 1094 have the biggest popularity in the whole database. We can see in the table that the most popular product have occured in our data base 871 times.

# 3 - Multivariative Distibution 

Next step was to look into variables and see if there are any coorelations between them. 


# Categorical Variables

First variables where : Division Name and Departament Name. 


```
##     Division Name Departament Name Frequency
## 1         General          Bottoms      2121
## 2  General Petite          Bottoms      1063
## 3       Initmates          Bottoms         0
## 4         General          Dresses      3165
## 5  General Petite          Dresses      2206
## 6       Initmates          Dresses         0
## 7         General         Intimate         0
## 8  General Petite         Intimate       188
## 9       Initmates         Intimate      1220
## 10        General          Jackets       547
## 11 General Petite          Jackets       332
## 12      Initmates          Jackets         0
## 13        General             Tops      5743
## 14 General Petite             Tops      2970
## 15      Initmates             Tops         0
## 16        General            Trend        88
## 17 General Petite            Trend        19
## 18      Initmates            Trend         0
```

As we can see the biggest heat is between Tops in the section General. From the heatmap we can assume that in section General theree is the biggest occurances of Tops and Dresses. In case of section General Petite the situation is exactlly the same. 

It was also important to see the percentage distribution of the same variables. 



![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->


The same action was done between variables Class Name and Departament Name. 









![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)<!-- -->

From the graphs we can see thet the biggest freaquency is between Knits and Tops and also between Dresses and Dresses. 


![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->
 
We can see that the biggest heat is between Knits and General and Dresses and General. 


# 3.2 -  Continuous Variables on Continuous Variables

We looked also into scatter plots with marginal densities for continous variables Age and Clothing ID. 
Other numberical variables didn't make sense to make scatter plots for them becouse they included categories for example variable Rating. 

![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

We can see that on this graph most of the variables focus near the valu O. We can also notice that the values are slightly coorelated.

4.3  - Sentiment Analysis 

In this part we created 2 new variables that would show the length of the review and count of the words in the review. 

Creation of a new varibales  Review length and Count words




Firstly we looked on the highlights of all the sentences. 
As we can see in the opended html , positive values are marked as green and negative as red. 
In many cases Review or Topic had more than one sentence for those cases values were averaged. 
Values that we recived are polinearity values. 


There were duplicated values than the polarity was averaged.

#  Coorelation Matrix

![](Aleksandra_Gawor_Miko쓰j_Gronowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png)<!-- -->

We can see coorelation between Review Text and Count words. 
Coorleation is also noticable between Rating and Recomended ID , Rating and Title Polarity,  Review Text Polarity and Title Polarity.

Based on the results we decided to get rid of variable Count Words. 


After that we have also changed the categorical variables to dummy variables so they can be used in our algoriths.
